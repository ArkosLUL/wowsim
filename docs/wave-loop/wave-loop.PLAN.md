# Wave loop: BiS optimizer, parity, item DB and raid import in one orchestrated program

## Context

The user wants a Best-in-Slot generator for the server ([bis-optimizer](../bis-optimizer/bis-optimizer.PLAN.md)).
BiS is only as good as the sim's parity with the server, so four efforts run together, in parallel work items
(WIs), from one orchestrator session:
- the remaining parity phases
- item-diff's AzerothCore item-DB mode
- raid-import Phase 3
- BiS

Each wave:
- An implementer agent and then a separate reviewer agent handle every WI, each WI on its own branch and
  worktree.
- The orchestrator merges the WIs into `integration`.
- `integration` fast-forwards `master`.

The procedure is in the [RUNBOOK](wave-loop.RUNBOOK.md).

## Decisions (settled with the user)

**Coordination**
- One loop and one integration branch for all four efforts. Parity is loop-driven.
- The orchestrator stops after every wave with a report and waits for "continue".

**Goldens and load**
- Golden-changing WIs are developed in parallel and promoted one at a time at integration.
- At most 4 WIs per wave, and at most 2 full-suite golden changers. P7 class WIs run only their own
  class's suites.
- BiS WIs change no goldens. BiS presets are new files, because the tests load
  `ui/<spec>/gear_sets/*.gear.json`.

**Specific WIs**
- P4 was committed unreviewed, so wave A reviews it (PAR-P4R).
- Recorded runs: playerbots fight a dummy in an instance, logged by Chronicle. A mismatch with the sim is a
  finding for that class's WI, not a blocker.

## Wave registry

G = changes goldens. FS = runs all 37 suites.

**Where the specs are:**

| WI prefix | Spec |
|---|---|
| `PAR-` | [parity PLAN, "Loop work items"](../azerothcore-parity/azerothcore-parity.PLAN.md) |
| `AC-` | [item-diff PLAN, "Loop work items"](../azerothcore-item-diff/azerothcore-item-diff.PLAN.md) |
| `RI-3` | [raid-import PLAN, Phase 3](../azerothcore-raid-import/azerothcore-raid-import.PLAN.md) |
| `BIS-` | [bis-optimizer PLAN, "Work items"](../bis-optimizer/bis-optimizer.PLAN.md) |

## Current wave

- Wave: D, running. Wave C (base `eaa6715af`) landed on `master`.
- Base SHA: `30137e6d1`.
- Workflow runId: `wf_86c44e1b-fe3`, resuming `wf_724d4586-625` after a session limit. Transcript dirs
  (`journal.jsonl`) are
  `C:\Users\boss2\.claude\projects\g--DevStuff-GitHub-wowsimwotlk\2b733101-1b9b-4106-be24-1e2f5864000d\subagents\workflows\<runId>`.
  PAR-P3-3's and BIS-ui-tab's finished implementer reports are in their worktrees' `tmp/impl-report.json`.
- Split between the two timing items: PAR-P3-2 applies cast times from serverdata's `CastMs`, which
  already has the ranged slot's +500 ms, and exposes a `Spell` method for the server entry. PAR-P3-3
  reads serverdata through one helper in `cast.go`; at integration, point that helper at PAR-P3-2's
  method.
